            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
              Our team brought together individuals with interest in Data Structures and Algorithms, as well as the Design and Analysis of algorithms. As a 
              4th-semester college project focused on Data Structures through project-based learning, we developed this project to effectively showcase our 
              skills and understanding in this subject.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project serves as a practical demonstration of our collective abilities in applying data structure principles to solve a real-world problem.
